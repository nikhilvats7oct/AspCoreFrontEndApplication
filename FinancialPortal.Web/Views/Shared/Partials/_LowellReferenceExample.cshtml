                            The claim number is located on the top right corner of the Claim Form or on the right hand side of any letters you have received from us since the claim was issued against you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Lowell reference number is the unique reference number located on the right hand side of any letters you have received from us.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You’ll need either your Lowell reference number or claim number to access your account. We need one of these numbers to find you on our system so we can give you the right help.
